#Michail’s Night At The Museum Project

As an exercise of an Udacity project, I have created a mobile VR application which is called NightAtTheMuseum. 
The creation process included the design, iteration through the development process and the user testing. After 
starting the application the user is located in a virtual car museum in front of a welcome screen. The screen 
explains the contents of the application and how the movement and interactions occur. The user can go through 
the museum and visit stations that explain the respective VR technology in the automobile industry.

###Considerations
There were a lot of design concepts to include in this project, but one of the most important was to create an 
atmospheric environment in which the user feels the mood of a virtual museum.

###IMPORTANT
Because of the repo contains Git LFS content, you have to download the repo via the command:
**git clone https://github.com/michailtam/P5-NightAtTheMuseum**, not using any 3rd-party client like
SourceTree.

##Night At The Museum
Users who have tested the application were very impressed with the big environment and the different kinds of VR 
technologies the museum introduces. In addition, the users were asked how they feel the speed of the navigation 
and if it makes them sick. All users had no experience with VR applications even on mobile phones nor on pc.

##Process
**Statement of Purpose:** NightAtTheMuseum is a mobile VR application that gives people a different way to visit 
a car museum.

###Persona
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michailtam/P5-NightAtTheMuseum/master/_README/persona.gif" width="160" height="200">

*The user persona tat was created for this project is called John. He is 48 years old and works in a museum as guidance. 
John is not married and spends his free time by going swimming at the nearest swimming pool. In addition he likes reading 
books about inovative technologies. He has no experience with VR.*

##Environment
There were no sketches for the environment drawn cause of that a prefab of a museum from the asset store was used.

##User Testing

###Testing the scene and mood

To test the VR application I conducted a user who had no experience with VR. At first, I tried to find out how big he felt in 
the museum, how the diference of is height to the next floor was and he felt the mood in the environment. The user felt his 
height was appropriate to the environment. He liked the relaxed music playing in the museum.

###Testing the movement and motion sickness    

I tried to know how the user felt about the movement speed and if he encountered any motion sickness at all. The user mentioned 
that he didn’t encounter any sickness. In addition, I asked him if he felt any height changing or disorientation in the movement,
he didn't.


###Testing the whole application from beginning to the end

The user said that in future there could be more VR stations to show additional technologies that will come. He felt no motion
sickness and problems by navigating through the museum.


###Testing the UIs

I asked him how the UI's were accessible and how he felt the interaction with them. He had nothing to complain about. 

##Breakdown of the Final Design

The steps for the final design included the building of all description UIs and editing the video files for better displaying.

##Conclusion

This sort of visiting a virtual car museum gave me a big challenge to implement new things like displaying a video on a canvas
without any or small delay by changing from frame to frame. It gave me a lot of fun to design and program the behavior.
I hope that this kind of application has inspired the users to test more VR apps in future.

##Next steps

In future there could be more floors that show more inovative VR technologies in the automobile industries.
